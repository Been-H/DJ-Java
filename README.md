# DJ-Java
A discord music bot in using Discord.py

Why is it called DJ Java if it's in python? Good question. Don't ask. We don't know either.

This is DJ-Java, a project me and Caleb Chen are working on for our discord server. It is going to be using Discord.py. Our goal is for it to be able to:

1. Play music and videos off of youtube (enter a video title and it returns the video)
2. loop
3. be able to view the quene

Eventually:
1. Implement Spotify's API
